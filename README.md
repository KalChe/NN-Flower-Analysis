# Flower Species Analysis
This is a project exploring machine learning to analyse 5 different visual aspects. This was done through 5 different flowers: dandelion, tulip, rose, sunflower, and daisy. I created a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) using pytorch, torchvision, numpy, keras, and matplot to create a neural network able to succesfully analyse these images with an accuracy exceeding 93%. The dataset that I used is provided by Kaggle and can be accessed with this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition/data).
